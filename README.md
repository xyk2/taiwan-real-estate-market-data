# Taiwan real estate transactions
Playing around with a dataset of all real estate sales, rentals, and land purchases in Taiwan from 2002 til 2018 (over 6 million transactions). Includes district, price sold, house size, building types, date of construction, and approximate addresses.

### Work to be done
- filter out outliers in the data set (source data not completely clean)
- geocode all addresses to latitude / longitudes
- Visualize with OSM or some kind of GIS tool
- cross reference with other data sets from the Land Adminstration, combine other relevant information

### Data source
Data was sourced from the [Department of Land Administration](http://plvr.land.moi.gov.tw/DownloadOpenData) as part of the Taiwan Open Data intiative.
